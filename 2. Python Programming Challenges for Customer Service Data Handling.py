# Task 1: Customer Service Ticket Tracker Demonstrate your 
# ability to use nested collections and loops by creating a system to 
# track customer service tickets.

# Problem Statement: Develop a program that:

# Tracks customer service tickets, each with a unique ID, 
# customer name, issue description, and status (open/closed).
# Implement functions to:
# Open a new service ticket.
# Update the status of an existing ticket.
# Display all tickets or filter by status.
# Initialize with some sample tickets and include functionality for additional ticket entry.
# Example ticket structure:

service_tickets = {
    "Ticket001": {"Customer": "Alice", "Issue": "Login problem", "Status": "open"},
    "Ticket002": {"Customer": "Bob", "Issue": "Payment issue", "Status": "closed"}
}
